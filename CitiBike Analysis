Customers Defined Analysis

  CitiBike NYC has seen a definitive change in their customer population. Taking a look at the data from the 2015s,
CitiBike was a relatively new concept and many have not been sold by the idea. However since the 2015s, the number of customers
has more than doubled. The number of men using CitiBike has more than doubled (12.5k to 29k), and the number of women using CitiBike
has found similar change starting at a measly 4k riders to now 11k riders. The increases in riders has also shown to be consistent since
CitiBike users are predominantly subscribers or have a 1 year subscription to the program. It can be concluded that both males and females
in the New York have received the CitiBike program with open arms and many have integrated bike riding into their lifestyle.

Customers' Travel Preferences
  Building onto the above conclusion, an extensive look into the data revealed that CitiBike users are shown to use its services
outside of Manhattan and mostly in the New Jersey suburbs. The age of customer's in the 2018s and 2019s have also shown a spike in the
50s age range, which can be inferred to fit the demographics of the suburbs rather than those of the inner city. It is also shown that most
riders are around the age of 30 and start and begin their trips in New Jersey. This shows that bikers' vouch for their safety since riding
in the suburbs is potentially less dangerous than in the busy streets of New York. Unfortunately, many of these conclusions have results based in
speculation, but that is due to the restrictions of the dataset. What can be inferred are definitive answers that users start and end their trips
in the suburbs.
